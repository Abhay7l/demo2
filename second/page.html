            There are certain factors you need to consider while planning for
            applying for a loan. Based upon your financial and repayment
            capacity, you will be required to calculate equated monthly
            installments (EMI). Here are a few factors to consider-
          </p>
          <p class="blank-line">&nbsp;</p>
          <ul class="term-of-the-loan">
            <li class="term-of-the-loan1">
              <span class="term-of-the">Term of the Loan</span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="blank-line">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="blank-line">
            A loan’s tenure may get reduced or extended. Subsequently, there
            will be an increase or a decrease in the EMI amount as well. Thus,
            considering the term of a loan is also an important factor that may
            affect your due amount.4
          </p>
          <p class="blank-line">&nbsp;</p>
          <ul class="term-of-the-loan">

          <p class="blank-line">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="blank-line">
            The rate of interest is a vital factor that will help to assess the
            installment amount owed. You can compare the product and opt for one
            which has a lower rate of interest so that your overall repayment
            stays low.
          </p>

          <p class="blank-line">
            Choosing the loan amount is another significant factor for
            determining your EMI. Based on the loan amount you choose, your
            equated monthly installment will be calculated accordingly.

                Often, a car loan’s EMI is supposed is to be repaid with due
                interest within a stipulated time to the lender. On failure,

            Personal loans are mostly taken to serve multiple purposes like
            medical emergency, vacation, relocation, wedding, home renovation,
            etc. Since they are an unsecured loan, they have a relatively higher
            interest rate and a shorter tenure. You can use the Personal Loan
            EMI Calculator of Groww to assess the loan and EMI amount that you
            can pay with ease. By entering your loan amount, rate of interest,
            and loan tenure, you can calculate your EMI.
